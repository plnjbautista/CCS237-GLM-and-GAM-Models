# CCS237 – GLM and GAM Models

## GLM and GAM Models Comparison on the STAR98 Dataset

## About

This paper compares the performance of **Generalized Linear Models (GLMs)** and **Generalized Additive Models (GAMs)** using the **STAR98 educational dataset**. The study focuses on modeling and understanding factors that influence educational outcomes by predicting the number of students scoring above the national median in mathematics (**NABOVE**) across California school districts.

This work is submitted as a **term paper in partial fulfillment of the requirements for the subject Computational Science (CCS237)**.

## Dataset

- **STAR98 Educational Dataset** (California, 1998)
- 303 school districts
- 22 numerical variables representing student demographics, teacher characteristics, and school resources

## Models

### Generalized Linear Models (GLMs)
- Linear (Gaussian)
- Log (Poisson)
- Gamma

### Generalized Additive Models (GAMs)
- Linear (Gaussian)
- Log (Poisson)
- Gamma

## Key Objective

The primary objective of this paper is to evaluate whether incorporating non-linear relationships through GAMs provides better predictive performance compared to traditional GLMs when modeling educational data.
